# Soggy Cupcakes

The code and content for my [personal site][soggy], which is generated by
[Jekyll] [jekyll] and hosted on [Amazon S3][s3].

## Setup

+ Install [gems][gems]: `bundle install`
+ Ensure S3 credentials are present in `.env` (excluded from source control);
[more information][s3website])

## Writing

+ Start local server for previewing: `script/server` (site will be available at
`localhost:4000`)
+ Add drafts to `_drafts`
+ Write, edit and repeat until "done"
+ Move completed posts from `_drafts` to `_posts`, using the
`YYYY-MM-DD-post-title` naming convention

## Publishing

Run `script/publish` to generate the site and publish it to S3. Ensure that the
local server is _not_ running to prevent publishing drafts, future posts or non-
indexed related posts.
