# Soggy Cupcakes

The code and content for my personal blog, which is generated by [Jekyll]
[jekyll] and hosted on [Amazon S3][s3].

## Setup

+ Install [gems][gems]: `bundle install`
+ Ensure S3 credentials are present in `.env` (excluded from source control);
[more information][s3website])

## Writing

+ Start local server for previewing: `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` (site
will be available at `localhost:4000`)
+ Add drafts to `_drafts`
+ Write, edit and repeat until "done"
+ Move completed posts from `_drafts` to `_posts`, using the
`YYYY-MM-DD-post-title` naming convention

## Publishing

+ Generate with better recommendations, no drafts, and no future posts: `bundle
exec jekyll build --lsi`
+ Push to S3: `bundle exec s3_website push`
