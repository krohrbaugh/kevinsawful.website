The [work to create the high definition video (HD) spec][hdtv-history] began the
same year that Nintendo released the [Family Computer][fami]. It took twenty
years for HDTV to become the norm, with high definition video output arriving on
game consoles in late 2005 ([Xbox 360][360]). Consoles from the [Magnavox
Odyssey][mag] to the [Nintendo Wii][wii] output only standard definition (SD)
analog signals.

Using SD consoles on HD displays often yields poor results. New TVs are
increasingly designed with digital video in mind, often including lower quality
components for the processing of analog input. This, combined with the poor
signal quality of [RF modulator][rf] and [composite video][composite]
connections, can lead to a muddy, disappointing picture.

Emulation is the typical solution to the problem, but I like playing on original
hardware. Since I don't have the space (nor any interest) in having a [CRT][crt]
set just for retro gaming, I decided to go for the least practical solution: a
video scaler combined with the best output option for a given system.

The first bit of equipment necessary is the video scaler. There are
[several options][sclr], but the most common setup typically involves the
[Micomsoft XRGB-Mini][xrgb]. While the hardware comes highly recommended, it has
several negatives: The device is only sold in Japan, includes poorly translated
English menus and a Japanese-labeled remote control ([English overlays available
on ebay][ebay-overlays].)

The video scaler provides the high definition digital input, but getting a clean
signal out of classic consoles often requires more than purchasing electronics.
For systems that predate [component video][component], the best option is
typically [RGB][rgb] via a [SCART][scart] cable. Some classic systems, including
most Sega consoles, output in this format _without_ modification. Others, such
as the NES, require extensive modification and [custom chips][nesrgb]. For more
details regarding the options for various consoles, the [RetroRGB][retro] site
has _lots_ of information.

As an example of the end-product, the following videos were captured using an
[Elgato Game Capture HD][capture-hd] from my [NESRGB-modified][nesrgb] top-
loader NES, upscaled to 1080p with the [XRGB-Mini][xrgb].

A video scaler solution is _not_ cheap and is likely to require modifications to
at least some of your game consoles. Admittedly, it's an impractical approach
for a pretty esoteric "problem". That's in no small part why I find it an
interesting and fun project.
